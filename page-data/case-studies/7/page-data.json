The capacity for digital twins to inform asset management strategies to bolster infrastructure and other assets in the face of future pandemics and climate change will undoubtedly increase their effectiveness and benefit.","3D Platform":"Unreal Engine","3D Platform Features":"Weather; View Analysis; Energy Modeling; Crowd Simulation; Traffic Simulation; Green Space Analysis; Optimizing Buildings’ Systems","3D Platform to Physical City Control":"Designers can simulate ideas in the live city environment before they are constructed, and understand in advance the impact of decisions such as where to position a bus stop, or the footprint of a new housing development.","Decision Making":"The digital replica could have the power to stimulate events in the city’s future with accuracy; The models are precise virtual representations of physical assets that are kept continuously up to date; Using an algorithm that converts data from a Geographic Information System into 3D information; 51 world’s intention is to turn this model into a digital twin – a virtual reflection of the live city that is continuously updated in near real-time; More focus on geographic information: sensors, satellites, drones and other sources","Contested Claims/Challenges":"Huge growth of urban populations to climate change and pandemics; Instantly raises questions about rights, ethics and ownership","FinalStatus":"In Progress"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
