The overhead project was experimenting with advanced technology by modeling a neighborhood in Helsinki, Kalasatama. The city information model allows users to perform a variety of analyses focusing on energy consumption, greenhouse gasses, or environmental impacts of traffic and weather. The Helsinki energy and climate atlas can be used to support energy efficiency improvement, energy consumption minimization, and renewable energy.","3D Platform":"Unreal Engine","3D Platform Features":"Visualization","3D Platform to Physical City Control":"N/A","Decision Making":"The digital twin can help simulate how different policies or individual decisions will impact the goals. For example, Helsinki has developed a service that use CityGML data to analyze solar radiation and the potential of renovation of roads, walls, doors and windows on carbon footprint. Homeowners that live in Helsinki can compare the cost of new insulation, windows, and heat pumps. The most successful projects included services for communicating about new residential development, a map of underground connections, and a way to show off the impact of new trees. The Helsinki energy and climate atlas can be used to support energy efficiency improvement, energy consumption minimization, and renewable energy. It was expected to help cities meet sustainability and development goals because they provide deeper insight into data hidden underneath the surface. Provide free access to the 3D data for educational and developmental purposes","Contested Claims/Challenges":"N/A","FinalStatus":"Completed"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
