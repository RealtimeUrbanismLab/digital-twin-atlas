The project aims to enable advanced grid modeling research (AGMR) integration with utility business systems through integrating and modeling using various data sources.","3D Platform":"AutoBEM","3D Platform Features":"Visualization (displaying the analysis data: potential savings after making recommended changes.)","3D Platform to Physical City Control":"","Decision Making":"Identifying via simulation-informed data and valuation for energy, demand, emissions, and cost impact for each building covering monetization scenarios.; Study cases and models informs BTO investment decisions.; The building energy models will support analysis for five utility-defined use cases including rate structure design, energy-efficiency program design, demand response program design, design for resiliency, and customer communications.","Contested Claims/Challenges":"Accuracy: building energy use can vary by 3x per year or 5x per month between an energy saver and an energy waster in a similar building.; Scale: Scalable and cost-permissive extraction of building-specific properties.; Privacy: Occupant behavior is a significant uncertainty and hard to mitigate due to privacy concerns."}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
