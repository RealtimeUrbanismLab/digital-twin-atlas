Dashboards are used to monitor and share data on mosquitoes to quickly identify vulnerable areas, so that problems can be intensively and preemptively controlled.","3D Platform":"ArcGIS Urban","3D Platform Features":"Water Utility Network Model, Fire Response Management, Traffic, Urban Sanitation, Facilities Management, Urban Development, City Revitalization.","3D Platform to Physical City Control":"Firefighting (on-site deployment of evacuation vehicles from the Industrial Fire Department); Environment (monitoring of garbage emission map); Transportation (city aviation) Transportation map pilot service); Facility management (solar power generation facility simulation); Urban development (3D visualization of Incheon Future Vision); Urban regeneration (precise 3D visualization near Jemulpo Station)","Decision Making":"Through this digital twin administrative transition, the city expands the three-dimensional simulation system that can predict and prevent urban problems to various administrative fields, and minimizes administrative errors and reduces social costs by providing a space where citizens can participate in municipal administration in three dimensions. try to reduce; Activities for improvements include a method for routing and tracking the location of street cleaning vehicles, so that managers have a better understanding of progress at any given moment. By creating maps of garbage and food waste disposal throughout Incheon and monitoring its status through an app, the department can understand how to effectively allocate cleaning vehicles.; The Incheon Fire Department has used the digital twin to launch an experimental program for allocating resources. By outfitting 35 fire trucks with receivers that use an IoT network and GPS for precise real-time positioning, the department has the real-time location for each truck. When the department is able to determine instantly where its resources are, it will definitely speed up response times.","Contested Claims/Challenges":"N/A","FinalStatus":"In Progress"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
