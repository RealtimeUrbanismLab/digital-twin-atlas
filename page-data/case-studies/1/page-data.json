It will provide the necessary data for Vienna and will be updated in real time.  It is through this kind of technology that better and more comprehensive access to the Vienna database can be made, and relevant decisions can be effectively responded to.","3D Platform":"PlanSinn; Physi, FIWARE","3D Platform Features":"Microcensus Data On Population; Socio-Economic Data; Energy Consumption Information; Facility Management; Monitoring Mobility; Harmonization Of Facility; CIM (City Information Model)","3D Platform to Physical City Control":"Digital geoTwin wants to provide a Digital image of the city, allowing the detection of existing processes in the city to generate new data. Planning is simulated in scenarios to achieve better data to optimize decisions.","Decision Making":"Optimize programs through machine learning; Existing geospatial data will be reconsidered and combined to form a more efficient and rational urban model","Contested Claims/Challenges":"The hardest part is not the data or technical details, but having to ensure that these planning environments truly reflect reality","FinalStatus":"In Progress"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
